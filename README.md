## Description
This is my first attempt of a Rock Paper Scissors Game(As of 8/29/2022). In the future I will be adding more complex aspects like an interface and UI.
For now I am just setting up the basic structure of JavaScript to get the ball rolling!
You can only play in the console and it cannot keep track of score as of 8/29/2022.
Now had UI as of 9/22/2022.
